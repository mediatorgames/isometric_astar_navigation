# isometric_astar_navigation
A demo showcasing navigation using the AStar node in an isometric game.

Contrast with the approach taken in [my other repo](https://github.com/mediatorgames/isometric_naive_navigation).

# installation
Youŕe going to need [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download) first.

Clone the repo, open the project with Godot and have fun with it!!
